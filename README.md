# speakers-wanted board

This project is intended to provide Techlahoma Usergroup Leaders a place to request speakers. Techlahoma uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) to communicate. If you aren't a part of our Slack channel, you can [sign up here](http://slack.techlahoma.org/).

The board may be used in this manner:

## I need speaker
  
  1. The UGL opens an issue at https://github.com/techlahoma/speakers-wanted/issues

  - Issue information should include:
    - Usergroup name
    - Contact person
    - Slack/Twitter handle for contact person
    - Brief description of talk/topic suggestion
    - Date for presentation

  3. Issue should be tagged with the appropriate usergroup  
  4. That's it!   
  
## I want to speak

  1. Browse through requests at [https://speakers-wanted.techlahoma.org](https://speakers-wanted.techlahoma.org)
  2. Contact the contact person listed on the request  
  3. Coordinate/give the talk!  
  4. That's it! Thanks for your help!
